## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is intended to be used to educate students about the four sections of the prework modules. There are four sections on the webpage about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Also if you use the DevTools console you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics learned from prework and choose one topic for the user to study first.
